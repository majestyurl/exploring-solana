        <h1>Exploring Solana</h1>
        <h2> The Basics...</h2>
        <p>Before we can get into exploring the Solana blockchain,<br> 
            we first have to get an understanding of what exactly.</p> 
        <p> A <b>blockchain</b> is essentially a ledger - a series of <br>
            records and data points, like a spreadsheet or accounting book. <br>
            The key difference between a blockchain & traditional spreadhseets <br>
            or accounting systems, is that blockchains are decentralized, <br>
            meaning instead of the information being stored in one place, <br>
            the information is stored accross multiple computers around the world <br> 
            connected to a network. </p>
        <p>This is beneficial because there is no single point of failure, meaning <br>
            if a computer on the network is compromised, the data can be verified <br> 
            by referencing the data stored on the other computers on networks. </p>
        <p> There are different blockchains people can use for different reasons. <br>
            Blockchains can be used to store data, value, or in Solana's case, <br>
            run programs.</p>
        <h2>Cryptography</h2>
        <p><b>Cryptography</b> is the art of keeping things secure - think <br>
            "encryption" or passwords. <b>Cryptocurrency</b> is a type of <br>
            currency based on cryptography. Transactions are decentralized <br>
            and as secure as any other encrypted data. What does this mean? <br>
            Its a very safe way of storing data and value with no choke points <br>
            or single points of failure and is very hard to manipulate. </p>
        <h2>Coins vs Tokens</h2>
        <p>What is the difference between a token and a coin? All blockchain <br>
            protocols have coins that represent value and can be traded. On Solana <br>
            this coin is called "SOL".</p>
        <p> Tokens, on the otherhand, are built on top of a base blockchain protocol <br>
            (layer one). All projects built on a blockchain are tokenized and the tokens <br>
            are used to do things on the blockchain through trading, including <br>
            executing smart contracts.</p>
        <h2>Smart Contracts</h2>
        <p> What exactly is a "smart contract"?</p>
        <p>A smart contract is a contract written into the code set to <br>
            automatically execute when certain conditions are met. Blockchains <br> 
            like Solana or Ethereum are capable of runnig smart contracts, <br>
            but Bitcoin cannot.</p>
        <h2>Dapps</h2>
        <p><b>Dapps</b> are decentralized apps, apps that have smart contracts<br>
            built into them.</p>
